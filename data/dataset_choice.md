## What the dataset should have
- At least around 500-1000 entries
- 10 or more features
- Not contain images as this makes it more difficult and none of us have prior ML experience
- Be interesting to work with

## Our ideas for possible datasets  

- Covid-19 [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imdevskp/corona-virus-report)  
  Thoughts: no one wants to hear about covid anymore, bit of a 'boring' topic
- Movies [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshitshankhdhar/imdb-dataset-of-top-1000-movies-and-tv-shows)  
  Thoughts: same issue, a bit boring
- NY Stock Exchange [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgawlik/nyse?select=fundamentals.csv)  
  Thoughts: initially a good idea, but not everyone in the group knows enough about stock exchange to make it interesting for everyone
- McDonald's Nutrition Facts [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mcdonalds/nutrition-facts)  
  Thoughts: this was our favourite until we found that it doesn't have a lot of data entries
- Wine Reviews [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zynicide/wine-reviews)  
  Thoughts: that's why we switched to this one about wine, staying at the same topic, but with an increased number of data entries
